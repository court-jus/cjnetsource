=========

About

[Current version][downloadcurrent]

Goal
----

Like in Tetris, it's not possible to win. So play until you lose. You lose when one of the columns fills.

Rules
-----

You are presented a board with cells. Cells can be empty : <img src="{{ media_url('img/netblocks/emptycell.png') }}" class="inlineimage" />, contain only wires : <img src="{{ media_url('img/netblocks/wiredcell.png') }}" class="inlineimage" /> or contain wires and a blue "source" : <img src="{{ media_url('img/netblocks/sourcedcell.png') }}" class="inlineimage" />.

To remove cells, you have to connect them with a source. Higher levels require you to connect more cells before being allowed to remove them.

From time to time, a new wave of random cells appears.

Controls
--------

* Left-clic : rotate cell anti-clockwise
* Right-clic : rotate cell clockwise
* Middle-clic : remove connected cells if allowed
* Space : require a new wave without waiting
